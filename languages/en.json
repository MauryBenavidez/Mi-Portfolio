Shortly after, I met a Calisthenics instructor and joined his classes. I liked this sport so much that even when the pandemic hit, I continued training at home and improving my physical skills. Nowadays, thanks to this sport, I've made great friends and acquired skills that few people can accomplish. It also turned me into a disciplined and consistent person, as I learned the multitude of things one can achieve by maintaining this lifestyle. Calisthenics has become a very important part of my life, and it's something I enjoy doing with all my heart, just like programming. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

With my siblings, we used to play, and I always enjoyed competing against them and trying to win. As I grew up, my love for video games continued, but in a different way: it became a kind of relaxing break from my daily life activities. Nowadays, although I don't have as much time to play as before, I still find joy in connecting with my friends and chatting while we play together. Video games are not only a source of entertainment but also a way to maintain bonds and share special moments with friends. üéÆ"
